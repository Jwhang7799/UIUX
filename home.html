      <div class=obs>What is a Water Sprinkler Controller?</div>
        <p style="width: 40rem; padding-bottom: 10rem;" >
          The water sprinkler controller allows any user to set two recurring schedules to water their lawn and includes various features
          such as timers to control water usage, three program start times to water multiple times in a single day, and a manual start button to 
          start the sprinklers immediately. This helps users never forget to turn the sprinklers on and allows them to do so at optimal times
          to prevent fungus from growing.

      <div class="op1">
        <div class="allObs">Observation #1:</div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            User 1 tried to turn the sprinklers on by pressing the ON button. However, after nothing happened,
            he pressed the MAN START/ADV button but still saw that nothing changed.
          </li>
          <li>
            After pushing some of the other buttons, he spent around a minute reading all of the labels. 
            He then twisted the turn dial to AUTO and was able to turn the sprinklers on by pressing MAN START/ADV again. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The user's approach was systematic. He pressed each button and turned the dial to each option to monitor how the screen would change.
          </li>
          <li>
            He kept twisting the turn dial between Days to Water and Program Start Time to set a schedule for the sprinklers.
          </li>
          <li>
            He was unable to schedule the sprinklers to turn on for a specific day. He gave up after 11 minutes.

            User 2 tried to turn the sprinklers on by pressing the ON button. However, after nothing happend,
            she pressed the A/B button.
          </li>
          <li>
            She also spent around a minute reading all of the labels.
            She tried pressing MAN START/ADV and then immediately pressing ON.
          </li>
          <li>
            She pressed the icon pictures.
          </li>
          <li>
            She first turned the dial to Water Time per Station and then pressed ON. After nothing happend, she turned the dial to 
            Saturday and pressed ON. This time, the sprinklers successfully turned on.
          </li>
          <li>
            She pressed the OFF button to turn the spinklers off but nothing happend. Soon after, she pressed MAN START/ADV again and saw that
            the sprinklers changed to a different station. She continued to press it until the sprinklers turned off.
          </li>
          <li>
            The user's approach was different in that she kept pressing the ON button and tried multiple ways to do so. This
            caused her to try different button combinations and to also try holding down the ON button.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 13 minutes, she was successfully able to schedule the sprinklers, however, she said that she did not understand what the difference
            between A/B and the three program start times was.

          </li>
          <li>
            After checking the dial, he immediately turned the dial to AUTO and pressed MAN START/ADV and the sprinklers turned on.
          </li>
          <li>
            To set the sprinklers for a schedule, he set the Program to B by pressing A/B, turned the dial to Tuesday and Saturday and pressed ON.
          </li>
          <li>
            He turned the dial to 1 on Program Start Times and set the time for 7:00 AM.

          <li>
            He turned the dial to Auto, and then finished.

          <li>
            Unlike the previous users, this user commented that he has used this sprinkler system contoller for years.
            He was able to turn the sprinklers on and set a new schedule within two minutes.

          <p class="summary">
            The three users had drastically different levels of familiarity with the water sprinkler system, causing each user to interact
            with the system differently. Though each user believed that the water sprinkler controller would allow them to turn the sprinklers on
            and off and to set a specific time to do so, their motivation for why they would use the system varied. Most notably, the first two
            users simply said that they would use the system to water their plants. However, the third user, who was the most experienced, said
            that his main motivation is so that he does not forget to water his lawn, to water the lawn early in the morning to give the lawn
            enough time to absorb the water before the sun comes out, and to prevent fungus from growing.
          </p>
          <p class="summary">
            Interestingly, although the first user was unsuccessful in scheduling the water system, he believed that the interface was fairly
            intuitive because of the clear labeling and rated it a 6/10. In contrast, the second and third users were adamant that the interface was
            the worst they had ever used, and both rated it a 1/10. All of the users agreed that the most unintuitive facet of the interface was 
            using the turn dial, found the screen to be difficult to read, and believed that a manual would be necessary for most users.

      <div class="obs">Insights and Project Takeaways</div>
      <p class="insight_desc">
        This project sought to objectively observe three users using a water sprinkler controller to uncover what contributes to a simple
        yet effective interface. Through interviews and observations, is is apparent that an interface that uses two distinct methods of 
        setting a user's preferences (e.g. having both buttons and a turn dial) hampers the interface's learnability. 
      </p>
      <p class="insight_desc">
        Another interesting insight is that while most users agreed that the interface was well-labeled, they still struggled to understand
        the difference between the A/B programs and the three program start times. This may have been caused by A/B being a button and 
        the program start times being listed as an option on the turn dial. Clearer descriptions are needed to help new users who may not know
        that some users water their lawn multiple times a day. Thus, an important takeaway is that overly complicated interfaces with too many options may overwhelm
        and frustrate new users.
